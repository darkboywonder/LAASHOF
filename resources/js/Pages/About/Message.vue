                                    Lexington has a unique sports history that
                                    has been articulated in many forms. However,
                                    contributions made by the African-American
                                    community have never been fully appreciated
                                    nor honored as they should. For many, the
                                    high school sports teams and legends from
                                    the segregated and early post-segregated era
                                    are now vague memories and, for today’s
                                    sports enthusiasts, totally unfamiliar.
                                </p>

                                    Back in the day, local youths spent
                                    countless hours competing at iconic
                                    neighborhood hubs such as South End’s Carver
                                    Center, East End’s Charles Young and Dunbar
                                    Centers, West End’s Douglass Park “Dirt
                                    Bowl,” Downtown’s Salvation Army and Second
                                    Street YMCA, and North End’s Green Acres and
                                    Hollow Creek Parks, just to name a few.
                                    These same young athletes would one day
                                    thrill us on Friday nights in overcrowded
                                    high school gymnasiums and stadiums with
                                    thundering slam dunks, end-zone
                                    celebrations, out-of-the-park grand slams,
                                    and exhilarating photo finishes at rival
                                    track and field meets.
                                </p>

                                    Some of these sports stars would go on to
                                    compete at the college and professional
                                    levels. As we watched them on television,
                                    and other forms of media, again we felt a
                                    sense of amazement, pride, and a connection
                                    to these home-grown sports stars and now ...
                                    legends. Soon these sports stars and teams
                                    will, too, become faded memories unless our
                                    own African-American community makes a
                                    concerted effort to pay homage to our local
                                    sports heritage.
